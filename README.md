# AIRLINE_BACKEND_SYSTEM

Objective:
We need to build a backend system that can support different features for an airline company. Our end user is going to be someone who wants to book flights and query about flights. So, we need a robust system to actually help them give the best experience possible. We want to prepare the whole backend keeping the fact in mind that the code base should be as maintainable as possible.
